# Config

Configuration of the editor app. Currently, this isn't used for much other than setting tab widths. In the future, it should be able to parse `toml` files and configure a number of settings for the app.

## Theme

Like the config, this does nothing right now but should be able to parse `toml` files to set the color theme of the app in the future.
